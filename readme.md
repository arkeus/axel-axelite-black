Axelite Black
====

A simple test game made for testing new features in Axel. The main focus is on improving AxTilemap and adding segmented tilemaps such that you can load arbitrarily large maps.

To test the current compiled version: http://paste.vigil.io/swf/f96
Note that it loads a 500x500 tilemap so it may take awhile on older CPUs.
